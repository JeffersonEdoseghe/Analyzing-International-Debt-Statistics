# Solutions
1. Inspecting The World Bank's international debt data set

SELECT *
FROM international_debt
LIMIT 10;

***

2. Finding the number of distinct countries
From the first ten rows, we can see the amount of debt owed by Afghanistan in the different debt indicators. 
But we do not know the number of different countries we have on the table. 
There are repetitions in the country names because a country is most likely to have debt in more than one debt indicator.
Without a count of unique countries, we will not be able to perform our statistical analyses holistically.

SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT country_name) AS total_distinct_countries
FROM international_debt;

***

3. Extracting the unique debt indicators
Knowing about the various debt indicators will help us to understand the areas in which a country can possibly be indebted to.

SELECT 
    DISTINCT indicator_code AS distinct_debt_indicators
FROM international_debt
ORDER BY distinct_debt_indicators;

***

4. Finding the total amount of debt owed by the different countries
The financial debt of a particular country represents its economic state.
But we want to project this on the overall global scale to give us a sense of how the overall economy of the entire world is holding up. 

SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(debt)/1000000, 2) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt; 

***

5. Finding the country owing the highest debt
This debt is the sum of different debts owed by a country across several categories.
This will help to understand more about the country in terms of its socio-economic scenarios.

SELECT 
    country_name, 
    SUM(debt) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY country_name
ORDER BY total_debt DESC
LIMIT 1;

***

6. Determining the average amount of debt across indicators
This will give us a better sense of the distribution of the amount of debt across different indicators.

SELECT 
    indicator_code AS debt_indicator,
    indicator_name,
    AVG(debt) AS average_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY debt_indicator, indicator_name
ORDER BY average_debt DESC
LIMIT 10;

***

7. Finding the country with the highest amount of principal repayments
We can see that the indicator DT.AMT.DLXF.CD tops the chart of average debt. 
This category includes repayment of long-term debts.
We want to investigate this a bit more to find out which country owes the highest amount of debt in the category of long term debts.

SELECT 
    country_name, 
    indicator_name
FROM international_debt
WHERE debt = (SELECT 
                 MAX(debt)
             FROM international_debt
             WHERE indicator_code = 'DT.AMT.DLXF.CD');

***

8. Finding the debt indicator that appears most frequently
China has the highest amount of debt in the long-term debt category. 
This is verified by The World Bank.
Now, we want to find the most common indicator in which the countries owe their debt.

SELECT 
    indicator_code,
    COUNT(indicator_code) AS indicator_count
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY indicator_code
ORDER BY indicator_count DESC, indicator_code DESC
LIMIT 20;

***

9. Getting the maximum amount of debt that each country owes
There are a total of six debt indicators in which all the countries listed in our dataset have taken debt.
This gives us a clue that all these countries are suffering from a common economic issue.
We want to find out the maximum amount of debt that each country has.
With this, we will be in a position to identify the other plausible economic issues a country might be going through.

SELECT 
    country_name,
    MAX(debt) AS maximum_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY country_name
ORDER BY maximum_debt DESC
LIMIT 10;
